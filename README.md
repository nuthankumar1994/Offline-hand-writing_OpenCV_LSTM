# Offline-hand-writing_OpenCV_LSTM

I have developed two method for the offline hand writing. Both uses OpenCV for segmentation of written names and identifying the letter. 
One method is build using CNN only and other method uses bidirectional LSTM along CNN. Both produced good result with >94% accuracy.
